# Acoupi Tutorials

This section of the documentation contains step-by-step tutorials to help you getting started with acoupi.
The tutorials aims to outline what acoupi is capable of while providing specific information such as installing acoupi, configuring a pre-built program, retrieving deployment information.

We hope the tutorials are broadly accessible to anyone with an interest in using acoupi.
