# Configuration

Once _acoupi_ has been installed on a device, users can configure a pre-built program.
_acoupi_ comes with default settings, which users can either accept or customise through the command line interface (CLI). 

## Configuring _acoupi_ programs via the CLI

- __default program__: The _acoupi default_ program is the most simplest program, handling only two tasks: recording and managing audio files.
- __connected program__: The _acoupi connected_ program extends the default program by adding messaging capabilities, allowing users to send messages to a remote server.

To select and configure your prefered _acoupi_ program,  use of the following commands:

!!! Example "CLI Command: _acoupi default_ program"

    ```bash
    acoupi setup --program acoupi.programs.default
    ```

!!! Example "CLI Command: _acoupi connected_ program"

    ```bash
    acoupi setup --program acoupi.programs.connected
    ```

Based on the selected program, users will be prompted with several questions during setup. 
To **accept** the default values, press the keyboard letter `y` or the key `Enter`. 
To **reject and modify** a setting, press the keyboard letter `n` and input a new value.

The video shows the configuration process for the _acoupi default_ program via the CLI.

## Configuration Parameters

### acoupi.programs.default

Below is an example of the configured parameters for the _default_ program in JSON format.

Audio recordings have a duration of 10 seconds and occur every 30 seconds between 4am and 11pm.
However, recordings are only saved between 11am and 3pm, and during a 30-minute window before and after dawn and dusk.

The values `0` for `frequency_duration` and `frequency_interval` indicate that no frequency filter is applied to save recordings.

The database storing the execution of _acoupi_ tasks and recordings of audion files is located in the `storages/` folder in the home directory.

!!! Example "CLI Command: view program configuration after setup"

    ```bash
    acoupi config get
    ```

!!! Example "CLI Output: _acoupi config get_"

    ```json
    {
      "timezone": "Europe/London",
      "microphone": {
        "device_name": "UltraMic 250K 16 bit r4",
        "samplerate": 250000,
        "audio_channels": 1
      },
      "recording": {
        "duration": 10,
        "interval": 30,
        "chunksize": 8192,
        "schedule_start": "04:00:00",
        "schedule_end": "23:00:00"
      },
      "paths": {
        "tmp_audio": "/run/shm",
        "recordings": "/home/pi/storages/recordings",
        "db_metadata": "/home/pi/storages/metadata.db"
      },
      "recording_saving": {
        "starttime": "11:00:00",
        "endtime": "15:00:00",
        "before_dawndusk_duration": 30,
        "after_dawndusk_duration": 30,
        "frequency_duration": 0,
        "frequency_interval": 0
      }
    }
    ```

!!! Tip "How to modify a value after setup?"
    
    You can modify the value of a parameter after an _acoupi_ program has been set up. This can be necessary either due to
    a misconfiguration or to make changes to the current program. To modify a parameter, use the command:


    !!! Example "CLI Command: modify a configuration parameter after setup"

          ```bash
          acoupi config set --field <parameter_name> <new_value>
          ```

      Replace the _`parameter_name`_ with the full name of the parameter to modified. For example, to update the recording start time to 10am, the CLI command would be as follow:

    !!! Example "CLI Command: modify recording start time"

          ```bash
          acoupi config set --field recording.schedule_start 10:00:00
          ```

The table below provides detailed information about the parameters available when setting up _acoupi_ _default_ program.

### acoupi.programs.connected

The _acoupi connected_ program extends the  _acoupi default_ program by adding configuration options for sending messages to a remote server. It retains all the settings from the _acoupi default_ program but introduces new parameters for network communication.

Messages can be sent using either the HTTP or MQTT protocol. At least one of these protocols must be configured. If neither protocol is setup, the program will raise an error. 

The messages and their statuses, indicating if they have been sent, and whether this was a success or a failure, are stored in a database called `messages.db`. By default, this file is located in the `storages/` folder in the home directory.

The `message_send_interval` parameter controls how frequently the _acoupi_ program checks for new messages to send (i.e., 120 seconds by default). Similarly, the `heartbeat_interval` determines how often a `heartbeat_message`is sent (i.e., 10 minutes by default).


!!! Example "CLI Output: _acoupi config get_"

    ```json
    {
      "recording": {},
      "paths": {},
      "messaging": {
        "messages_db": "/home/pi/storages/messages.db",
        "message_send_interval": 120,
        "heartbeat_interval": 600,
        "http": {
          "base_url": "https://test_acoupi.org/",
          "content_type": "application/json",
          "timeout": 5
        },
        "mqtt": {
          "host": "test_acoupi.mqtt.org",
          "username": "test_username",
          "password": "mqtt_password",
          "topic": "acoupi",
          "port": 1884,
          "timeout": 5
        },
      },
      "recording_saving": {},
    }
    ```
