# acoupi

## What is acoupi?

**acoupi** is an open-source Python package that streamlines bioacoustic classifier deployment on edge devices like the Raspberry Pi.
It integrates and standardizes the entire bioacoustic monitoring workflow, from recording to classification.
With various components and templates, **acoupi** simplifies the creation of custom sensors, handling audio recordings, processing, classifications, detections, communication, and data management.

## Requirements

Acoupi has been designed to run on single-board computer devices like the [RaspberryÂ Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) (RPi).
Users should be able to download and test acoupi software on any Linux-based machines with Python version >=3.8,<3.12 installed.

- A Linux-based single board computer such as the Raspberry Pi 4B.
- A SD Card with 64-bit Lite OS version installed.
- A USB Microphone such as an [AudioMothÂ USBÂ Microphone](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth) or an Ultramic 192K/250K.

??? tip "Recommended Hardware"

    The software has been extensively developed and tested with the RPi 4B.
    We advise users to select the RPi 4B or a device featuring similar specifications.

## Installation

To install and use the bare-bone framework of acoupi on your embedded device follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Install acoupi and its dependencies

```
curl -sSL https://github.com/acoupi/acoupi/raw/main/scripts/setup.sh | bash
```

**Step 2:** Configure an acoupi program.

```
acoupi setup --program `program-name`
```

`acoupi` includes a default program for recording and saving audio files based on your settings, similar to an AudioMoth setup.
To start using it, simply enter the following command:

```
acoupi setup --program acoupi.programs.default
```

**Step 3:** To start a deployment of `acoupi` with the configured program run the command:

```
acoupi deployment start
```

??? tip "Using acoupi from the command line"

    To check what are the available commands for acoupi, enter `acoupi --help`. Also look at the [CLI documentation](reference/cli.md) for further info.

## Ready to use AI Bioacoustics Classifiers ðŸš€

`acoupi` simplifies the use and implementation of open-source AI bioacoustics models.
Currently, it supports two classifiers: BatDetect2, developed by [@macodhaÂ andÂ al.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.14.520490), and BirdNET-Lite, developed by [@kahstÂ andÂ al.](https://github.com/kahst).

??? warning "Licenses and Usage"

    Before using a pre-trained AI bioacoustic classifier, review its license to ensure it aligns with your intended use.
    `acoupi` programs built with these models inherit the corresponding model licenses.
    For further licensing details, refer to the [FAQ](faq.md#licensing) section.

??? warning "Model Output Reliability"

    Please note that `acoupi` is not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of model predictions.
    It is crucial to understand the performance and limitations of each model before using it in your project.

### BatDetect2 ðŸ¦‡

The BatDetect2 bioacoustics DL model has been trained to detect and classify UK bats species.
The [**acoupi_batdetect2**](https://github.com/acoupi/acoupi_batdetect2) repository provides users with a pre-built acoupi program that can be configured and tailored to their use cases.

The program can directly be installed with the following command:

```
pip install acoupi_batdetect2
```

And to set up and configure the `acoupi_batdetect2` program, run the command:

```{bash}
acoupi setup --program acoupi_batdetect2.program
```

### BirdNET-Lite ðŸ¦œ

The BirdNET-Lite bioacoustics DL model has been trained to detect and classify a large number of bird species.
The [**acoupi_birdnet**](https://github.com/acoupi/acoupi_birdnet) repository provides users with a pre-build acoupi program that can be configured and tailored to their use cases of birds monitoring.

To install the `acoupi_birdnet` program run:

```{bash}
pip install acoupi_birdnet
```

And to setup and configure it run:

```
acoupi setup --program acoupi_birdnet.program
```
