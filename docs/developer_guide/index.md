# Developer Guide

Welcome to the advanced guide on how to configure your own  **acoupi** program to customize your smart monitoring sensor. This section of the documentation is intended for users who wish to configure the existing **acoupi** functionalities beyond the basic configuration options.

Read the [**acoupi architecture**](/docs/developer_guide/architecture.md) to get a feel of how **acoupi** works internally. Then you can dive into the details of the various layers. [**Data schema**](/docs/developer_guide/data_schema.md) is the most basic layer of the framework and that make up the system. The [**Components**](/docs/developer_guide/components.md) are the building blocks of all **acoupi** functionality. The [**Tasks**](/docs/developer_guide/tasks.md) section describes how to integrate component into meaningful tasks. The [**Programs**](/docs/developer_guide/programs.md) section how
to bind multiple tasks together into useful programs to be run on the devices.
