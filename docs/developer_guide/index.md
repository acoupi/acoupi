# Developer Guide

Welcome to the advanced guide on how to configure your own **acoupi** program to
customize your smart monitoring sensor. This section of the documentation is
intended for users who wish to configure the existing **acoupi** functionalities
beyond the basic configuration options. 

This section of the guide will also be of interested to those who wish to learn more about acoupi archictecture.  

Read the [**acoupi architecture**](architecture.md) to get
a feel of how acoupi works internally. Then you can dive into the details of the various layers. [**Data schema**](data_schema.md) is
the most basic layer of the framework and ensure the flow of information between the layers of the system. The [**Components**](components.md) are the building blocks of
all acoupi functionality. The [**Tasks**](tasks.md)
section describes how to integrate component into meaningful tasks. The
[**Programs**](programs.md) section explains how to bind multiple
tasks together into useful programs to be run on the devices.
