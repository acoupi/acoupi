# Developer Guide

Welcome to the advanced guide on how to configure your own **acoupi** program to
customize your smart monitoring sensor. This section of the documentation is
intended for users who wish to configure the existing **acoupi** functionalities
beyond the basic configuration options.

Read the [**acoupi architecture**](architecture.md) to get
a feel of how **acoupi** works internally. Then you can dive into the details of
the various layers. [**Data schema**](data_schema.md) is
the most basic layer of the framework and that make up the system. The
[**Components**](components.md) are the building blocks of
all **acoupi** functionality. The [**Tasks**](tasks.md)
section describes how to integrate component into meaningful tasks. The
[**Programs**](programs.md) section how to bind multiple
tasks together into useful programs to be run on the devices.

> [!IMPORTANT] From this point on, we assume that you have a basic understanding
> of Python. If you are not familiar with Python, we recommend that you first
> get familiar with the language before continuing.
